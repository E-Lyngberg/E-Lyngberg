## About Me :blush:
Hi there, I'm Emmanuel! I am a recent Masters graduate in Applied Math from Georgia Tech where I earned a 4.0 GPA during my time in the program. I was a member of the first round of BS/MS math students at Georgia Tech and finished both my B.S. and M.S. in math in an accelerated 5 year period. I am passionate about Data Science and Mathematical Modeling, and am particularly interested in how modeling can improve healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. During my time working at CVS Health I built a predictive machine learning model to help pharmacists space out prescription fill times based on patient arrival times whilst reducing the number of instances where patients arrive and are unable to pick up their prescription at that time. At Janssen Pharmaceuticals I helped build and maintain batch process models that tracked key metrics to make sure drug manufacturing processes followed the highest GMP standards whilst allowing us to identify anomalies in real time so that onsite engineers have more time to problem solve. In addition to that I identified a key correlatory relationship between UV profiles and purification levels to automate a purification step in a drug process that was being commercialized at the time, saving half a dozen hours per batch as well as tens of thousands of dollars in equipment and technician hours. 


## What I Am Currently Up To... :construction_worker: :microscope:

At the moment I am working on understanding a new long time horizon forecasting model called [FlowMixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16786) and intend to re-implement it, validate the paper's results, and apply the model to new data that might be well suited for it. 

Additionally, I aim to enrich my understanding of the latest agentic capabilities by using the OpenAI Agentic SDK to build a self propogating agentic system that identifies the latest research in medicine and AI given a specific target disease or demographic area. The non-deterministic nature of these systems presents infinite opportunities (literally and figuratively) but also presents increased challenges in managing outcome spaces, hallucanations, token usage efficiency, and interpretability of their decision making.
